Suppose we have a data set $\mathbf{X} = \{\mathbf{x}_1,...,\mathbf{x}_n\}$ consisting of $N$ observations of a random $D$-dimensional variable $\mathbf{x}\in \mathbbm{R}^{D}$. Our goal is to partition the data into some number $K$ of clusters.  Intuitively, we may think of a cluster as comprising a group of data points whose inter-point distances are small compared with the distances to points outside of the cluster.

This notion can be formalized by introducing a set of $D$-dimensional vectors $\boldsymbol{\mu}_k$, which represents the centers of the clusters. Our goal is to find an assignment of data points to clusters, as well as a set of vectors $\{\boldsymbol{\mu}_k\}$. Objective function of $K$-means clustering (distortion measure) can be defined as follows:
$$J =  \sum_{n=1}^{N}\sum_{k=1}^{K}r_{nk}||\boldsymbol{x}_n-\boldsymbol{\mu}_k||^2$$
, where $r_{nk}\in\{0,1\}$ is a binary indicator variable which represents the membership of data $\mathbf{x}_n$. It can be defined as follows:
$$r_{nk}=\begin{cases}
1 & \textrm{if } k=\argminE_{j} ||\boldsymbol{x}_n-\boldsymbol{\mu}_j||^2\\
0 & \textrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$
Subsequently, fix the cluster, and optimize the objective function with  $\boldsymbol{\mu}_k$
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $$2\sum_{n=1}^{N}r_{nk}(\boldsymbol{x}_n-\boldsymbol{\mu}_k) = 0$$
	\item $$\boldsymbol{\mu}_k = \frac{\sum_n r_{nk}\boldsymbol{x}_n}{\sum_n r_{nk}}$$
\end{enumerate}
The denominator of $\boldsymbol{\mu}_k$ is equal to the number of points assigned to cluster $k$. The mean of cluster $k$ is essentially the same as the mean of data points $\mathbf{x}_n$ assigned to cluster $k$. For this reason, the procedure is known as the $K$-means clustering algorithm. 

The two pahses of re-assigning data points to clusters and re-computing the cluster means are repeated in turn until there is no further change in the assignments. These two pahses reduce the value of the objective function $J$, so the convergence of the algorithm is assured. However, it may converge to a local rather than global minimum of $J$.
